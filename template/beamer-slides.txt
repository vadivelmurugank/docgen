A Need
======

One definite need is a test document that all slide writers
should be able to handle.

The present document has very low requirements.
Because it does not include:

- subtitle
- sections
- subsections

it is not an adequate test document.  (See below.)
But certainly all writers should be able to handle the present document.

Some Problems
=============

1. There is no settled reST slide format, so writers
   do not offer consistent handling

2. The following are desirable but potential conflict:

   - title
   - optional subtitle
   - optional sections
   - optional subsections
   - implementing slides with standard reST sectioning

     - easier to write
     - looks a lot better as text

3. Lack of math support is pretty devastating.
   (Why hasn't Jens work been moved to the docutils core,
   at least as an experimental feature?)


Solution to Problem 2
=====================

Possibility 1: the lowest section level present is always treated as a slides.
(Note that if you want any slide in a sections or
subsection, the first slides must be in a section
and in a subsection.)  rst2beamer takes this approach;
rst2s5 does not.  It seems to be a correct default.

This default could be overridden with an option:
``--slide-section-level=N``


Test Suite
==========

Here is a test suite based on the \lowest subsection solution.

- http://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/misc/slides_test02.rst
- http://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/misc/slides_test03.rst
- http://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/misc/slides_test04.rst


Another Solution to Problem 2
=============================

Possibility 2 (suggested by Guenter Milde): slide writers should recognize a
``slide`` class on objects,
putting any object tagged with this class into a slide.

This would be excellent and very flexible.
In this setting, he proposes that the option
``--slide-section-level=N``
simply tag all sections at that level.

If the default is ``--slide-section-level=0``
and that means "tag the lowest subsection level",
this has a good fit with the previous proposed solution.

A question: how to handle the case where two nested
objects are both tagged with the ``slide`` class?


Additional Proposals for Slide Writers
======================================

Recognize the following special class arguments
(proposed by G. Milde):

overlay
   place object on a new "overlay" (which gives the appearance of
   incremental exposure of a given slide).
notesonly
   do not place object on any slide (i.e. ignore when producing slides)
   (Achievable via docutils ``strip-elements-with-class`` setting).
slidesonly
   do not place object in the notes (i.e. when generating
   standard HTML/LaTeX/PDF output for the handout or notes).
   (Achievable via docutils ``strip-elements-with-class`` setting).


Additional Proposals for Slide Writers
======================================

Additionally:
it is important to be able to tag lists (at least)
as say ``incremental``, to signal to the writer to generate
a sequence of overlays.



HTML Slides: rst2s5
====================

rst2s5 is part of the standard docutils distribution.

::

  rst2s5 --theme=small-white slides.rst slides.html

There is a useful introduction: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/slide-shows.html


rst2s5 Limitations
==================

- no sectioning.
- browser font resizing is disabled


rst2s5 Improvement Suggestions
==============================

- allow slides to be within sections and subsections

  - display these instead of the title at the bottom


PDF Slides: rst2pdf
===================

Solution: ``rst2pdf``

- available on Pypi.
- available from http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/

::

  rst2pdf -b2 -s a4-landscape -o c:\temp\temp.pdf slides.rst 

There is a helpful `rst2pdf manual`_
You may also want to look Roberto Alsina's `slides.style`_.

.. _rst2pdf manual: http://rst2pdf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/manual.txt
.. _slides.style: http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar/static/rst2pdf-slides/slides.style


rst2pdf Limitations
===================

rst2pdf has

- math directive and role
- great flexibility of style

So with the right style file, there may be no limitations
relevant to this summary.  But

- be sure to upgrade to latest ReportLab to get PNG images to work
- there is no support for PDF 1.6 images
- I don't know how to do incremental revelation of slide material
- I like beamer's handling of sections and subsections
  (i.e., display in headers or footers, not on separate slides)
  but I don't know how to get that from rst2pdf
 

PDF Slides: rst2beamer
======================

Solution: ``rst2beamer``

- old version available on Pypi (authors are Ryan Krauss and Paul-Michael) has some bugs.
- working version is in docutils sandbox

::

  rst2beamer slides.rst slides.tex
  pdflatex slides.tex slides.pdf

Quick notes: http://www.agapow.net/software/rst2beamer

Comment: this solution produces very good looking output.

rst2beamer Limitations
======================

- unlike rst2latex, Unicode characters are not translated
- no math directive or role
  - but can add math as raw LaTeX
- every slide is assigned ``fragile`` option -> amsmath is broken
- every slide is incremental by default (ugh!); cannot turn
  on incremental on per-slide basis.  However, can turn off
  incremental for the whole set with ``--overlaybullets=False``.
- literal text handling is partly broken; it should copy the
  approach in rst2latex
- suppose you want a one row, two-column table with a figure
  in one cell and a related list in the other (i.e., a standard
  presentation slide style).  rst2beamer will not be correctly format this.
  (Nor will rst2latex, for that matter.)

 
rst2beamer Improvement Suggestions
==================================

- use classes (e.g., ``fragile``, ``incremental``) to switch
  on options.  Don't make slides fragile and incremental by
  default.
- handle literal text like rst2latex does; the current
  approach does not work correctly
- handle math like rst2latexmath does
 
rst2beamer Improvement Suggestions
==================================

Here is a reason not to set the ``fragile`` option by default:

    12.9     Verbatim and Fragile Text
    If you wish to use a {verbatim} environment in a frame,
    you have to add the option [fragile] to the {frame}
    environment. In this case, you really have to use the
    {frame} environment (not the \frame command) and the
    \end{frame} must be alone on a single line. Using this
    option will cause the frame contents to be written to an
    external file and then read back. See the description of
    the {frame} environment for more details.

 
rst2beamer Improvement Suggestions
==================================

An example implication: suppose you put in a slide::

        .. raw:: latex

           \[ a = b \]

Then rst2beamer will write a document that won't compile
(because the fragile option is set, but ``\end{frame}``
will not be on its own line).  However this can be fixed
by adding an reST comment line.


ODP Slides
==========

Solution: rst2odp

- available on PyPI
- development version in docutils sandbox

::

  rst2opd slides.rst slides.odp


rst2odp Limitations
======================

- does not handle subtitle
- does not handle citations
- I have not been able to get it to work

PowerPoint Slides
=================

Solution: rst2outline http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/rst2outline/

::

   rst2outline slides.rst slides.txt
   powerpnt.exe slides.txt

This solution takes advantage of how PowerPoint reads plain text files
(as described at http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00246.htm).

rst2outline Limitations
=======================

- only handles text
- no title, subtitle, or sectioning
